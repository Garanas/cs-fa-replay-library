# Replay parser for Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance (Forever)

A small library to read and interpret replays of the game [Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance Forever](https://store.steampowered.com/app/9420/Supreme_Commander_Forged_Alliance/). It also supports the compressed replay format of [FAForever](https://faforever.com/). It is inspired by a similar [Java implementation](https://github.com/FAForever/faf-java-commons/blob/develop/faf-commons-data/src/main/java/com/faforever/commons/replay/ReplayLoader.java).

## References

The library attempts to use the latest and greatest of C#. This is made possible because of various books and online education content:
